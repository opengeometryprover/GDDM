Co fulers related to Parallel line

1, IFAB [ BC, then Collinear(A8,C),

2. Fortwo angle Â£12), 2113/4). If 11 =13 and 2 | l4, then 211.2) = 2113.4)

3. iFAB | CD and is the intersection of AC and BD, then EA / EC = EB/ED.

4, IFAB | CD and CD EF, then AB EF.

ers related to Perpendicular line

5, IFAB 1 CD, then Z{AB,CD] = [1] (or 90 degrees)

6. Inrighttriangle ACB, ZC = {1}, if midpoint(E, AB), then Circumcenter (EA B C) and EA = EB= EC.
7. IAB LCD and CD EF, then AB | EF.

8. For four points &,8,C,D, ifAC BC and AD 1 BD, then Cyclic(A,B,C,D)

$ Cl hulers related to Circle

9, For a circle c(0,AB) and a point C on Circle c, if Collinear(A,8,0), then AC L BC and ZACB = [1]
10. If AB is the Diameter ofa circle and point Cis on the circle, then AC. BC

11. Angle of circumference equals to half of angle of center

12, IFAB | CD and Cyclc(A.B,C,0), then ZABC = ZDAB

13, If CyclicA,8,C,D), then ZADB = ZACB and vice verse.
