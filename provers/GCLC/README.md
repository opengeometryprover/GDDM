# GCLC

GCLC (Geometry Constructions -> LaTeX Converter) is a mathematical software for producing high-quality mathematical illustrations, for teaching mathematics, and for automated proving of geometry theorems.  As a theorem prover it implements Wu's method, Groebner bases method and the area method.

GCLC is an independent project by Predrag Janicic that has, among others, Goran Predovic (Wu's and Groebner bases) and Pedro Quaresma (area method) as coauthors.
