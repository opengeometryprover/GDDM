# GCLC

GCLC (Geometry Constructions -> LaTeX Converter) is a mathematical software for producing high-quality mathematical illustrations, for teaching mathematics, and for automated proving of geometry theorems.  As a theorem prover it implements Wu's method, Gröbner bases method and the area method.

GCLC is an independent project by [Predrag Janičić](https://github.com/janicicpredrag).  Among its coauthors are:
- Goran Predović (Wu's and Gröbner bases methods);
- [Pedro Quaresma](https://github.com/GeoTiles) (area method).
