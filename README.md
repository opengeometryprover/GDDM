Open Library of Geometry Automatic Theorem Provers

---

OpenGeometryProver aims to integrate different efforts in the development of geometry automated theorem provers (GATP), namely:

- to provide a common open access repository for the development of GATPs;
- to provide an API to the different GATP in such a way that they can be easily used by users;
- to develop portfolio strategies to allow choosing the best GATP for any given geometric conjecture;
- to interface with repositories of geometric knowledge, e.g. TGTP, TPTP;
- to develop a GATP System Competition to be able to rate GATPs.
