# Open Geometry Prover Provers Executable

This folder contains the locally downloaded versions of the available provers.

On an Ubuntu system run `./bootstrap-ubuntu.sh` first to install the prerequisites.
Other systems may require similar commands to install the required tools first.

After installing the prerequisites, run `./build.sh`. It will download the
available provers and make shortcuts for them.
